# JellyButton-Test

This repository includes the test that got me earlier this year into Jelly Button's Merge Stories.
In addition to the test itself I've also provided a windows build, and a pdf with the planning process I went through.

The project was created according to a design document that was provided by the company.
Along with the desgin document, I also received a Unity package with textures and models. Part of the test was putting everyting together.
In the same package there was also a more stripped down version of the TargetFollower.cs file, and one of the requirements was to add more functionality to it.

It was a lot of fun, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity I was given to work as a Unity developer at a wonderful place such as Jelly Button.
